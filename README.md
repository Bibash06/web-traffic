About Tasty Bytes

Tasty Bytes was founded in 2020 in the midst of the Covid Pandemic. The world wanted inspiration so we decided to provide it. We started life as a search engine for recipes, helping people to find ways to use up the limited supplies they had at home.
Now, over two years on, we are a fully fledged business. For a monthly subscription we will put together a full meal plan to ensure you and your family are getting a healthy, balanced diet whatever your budget. Subscribe to our premium plan and we will also deliver the ingredients to your door.

At the moment, we choose manager favorite recipe from a selection and display that on the home page. We have noticed that traffic to the rest of the website goes up by as much as 40% if we pick a popular recipe. But we donâ€™t know how to decide if a recipe will be popular. More traffic means more subscriptions so this is really important to the company.
To do list:
- Predict which recipes will lead to high traffic?
- Correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time?
